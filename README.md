# SimpleAnimationPlacement
Predefined skeleton animation placement and play on detected plane.
Sceneform can not deal with 3D animated models as .fbx or .glTF. but in Android Studio 3.5.1 and LOWER (weird but not a mistake) you can convert .fbx animated files to .sfa and .sfb files with Sceneform plugin and those can be used.
